"Hello World" for a virtual world using Three.js

This mashup is a heavily modified tps from Yomotsu's example linked at the Threejs.org wiki.
In it, you 'll find javascript using Three.js to create:

* Skybox
* Heightmap terrain
* Character walk on uneven terrain using a Raycaster
* Character manipulation with both mouse/keyboard and touch for phones/tablets

Each of the components was created using code from others' examples, the sources are cited in
the source code.

You can simply load index.html in your browser and walk through La Pedriza.
